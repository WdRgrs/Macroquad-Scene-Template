This is a simple scene / state-management template to spin up a quick Macroquad project.

To get started, clone with a new project name:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/you/Macroquad-Scene-Template.git <AWESOME_GAME_NAME>

cd <AWESOME_GAME_NAME>
cargo run
```

Added some handy scripts for easy build/deploys for itch.io (more to come)
